#Detailed Description
The project is a simple weather application which guides travelers and drivers as they navigate different areas having diverse climatic conditions.

Various people on the road are at a disadvantage because they are not able to tell the definate climatic condition of the regions they are approaching.

Preparing well in advance assists in enabling caution for the driver and the travelers. The travelers can then put on protective clothing in case of colder conditions.

The application uses the openweather api to find updates concerning weather and climatic conditions in general.

The api is linked to the search field from where the approaching destination is to be indicated by the driver/traveler. 

The application uses CSS, HTML and JavaScript to achieve it's core objectives. The HTML document is where structure of the document is outlined. The application takes in a simple structure because of the preciseness with which it is intended. The JavaScript is meant to add funtionality to most features in the application.

Features such as event listeners and other DOM manipulation tricks makes it easier to link the api from open weather to my project. Finally, the CSS is majorly concerned with offering styling elements to the application. The CSS imports some fonts from google apis which are critical to how the font styling of the project should be.

*N/B: Kidndly press enter on your keyboard after typing in the town you are approaching so that you can determine the prevailing climatic conditions.
